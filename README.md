Number Guess Apps
=======================

Various implementations of an application that asks the user to guess a randomly chosen number. The app:

- should set a default value of 100 on the upper bound of the range from which the number is chosen, but allow the user to optionally override this default
- should give the user "No, go higher" and "No, go lower" hints for incorrect guesses
- should terminate when the user correctly guesses the number, informing the user how many guesses they took
